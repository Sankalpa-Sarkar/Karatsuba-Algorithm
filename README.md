# Karatsuba-Algorithm
A detailed project on the Karatsuba Algorithm, prepared as part of a college-mandated project, elaborating on the algorithm design and analysis techniques of the same while preparing a simple program to define the problem.

A detailed insight into the analysis and design of the Karatsuba Algorithm for Fast Multiplication including but not limited to a brief history of the design of the algorithm as well as the problem statement, while also defining the algorithm and a simple Java program to define the same. The computation of the complexity of the algorithm as well as the asymptotic bound of the algorithm using Master's Theorem for Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
